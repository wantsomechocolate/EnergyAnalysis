## Link over monthly numbers based off billing inteval data and normalizing
## the cost for time?

## HDD and CDD should be obtained automatically for the given month(s) being
## analyzed

## PAGE 2
## Create that text based on the percentages above or below the band.

## Have some hidden tabs that have the data for the daily graph with the band

## Have the weather graph populate automatically, but the colors at bottom
## will have to be adjusted manually

## PAGE 3
## Bring over stuff from results in a hidden tab so that the graph updates
## automatically

## Populate table automatically

## This one might be more difficult Think of a way to generate the
## Hours of operation bar.

## Leave the operational hours analysis manual

## PAGE 4
## Consider having the calendars filled in automatically in another book
## and pasted over?
## Because I know the day of the week and the day of month I think I
## can make a matrix of the month with the numbers in the right spot
## I might be able to color them as well, but they would still need to be pasted
## The red borders could be done as well

## The days good and bad can be calculated and presented easily

## The peak demand for the month is easy to get

## The peak weak for each month
## I'm pretty sure I'm calculating this already, but I need to actually print
## it to the results sheet and then link over either the data or the graph
## for each month. the red boxes have to be placed manually

## The stuff next to the graphs should be filled out automatically.

## PAGE 5
## The bucket analysis graph can be linked over automatically
## the percentages underneath can also be linked over automatically
## Instead of linking, condider doing the entire calculation in python.

## PAGE 6-9 for another data stream will have the same fate

## PAGE 10
## Nothing to automate on this page.

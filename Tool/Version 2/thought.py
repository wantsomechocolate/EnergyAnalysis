## The plan is to use classes and do the same exact thing as the old program
## Should there be an object that actually fetches the data from each workbook?
## There could be a workbook class that has each sheet, just the name and it can make
## classes or objects based on those names? I'm not sure.

## At least each sheet can have an object with each columns of data being.... another object?
## What about when the data is stored by day? can each day be its own object?
